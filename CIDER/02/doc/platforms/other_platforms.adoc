= Other Platforms

== Overview

Here "other platforms" essentially means any (Clojure) platforms that hasn't been mentioned specifically earlier in a dedicated section of the documentation.

As noted earlier in the documentation, down the road CIDER might support non-Clojure platforms as well. As things stand today, however, that's not particularly high on our list of priorities.

== Usage

As of CIDER 1.6, the default CIDER connection command `cider-connect-clj` is capable of connecting to any nREPL server that implements the core nREPL protocol interface. So, all you need to do is the following:

* Start an nREPL server (the project's README  usually has a section on starting a nREPL server).
* kbd:[M-x `cider-connect-clj` <RET>]

And that's it! You'll get every feature that's implemented by the nREPL server you're using.

== Supported Platform

Here's an incomplete list of Clojure platforms that you can use as described above.

* https://github.com/babashka/scittle[scittle]
* https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride[joyride]

NOTE: For `nbb` you can alternatively connect via `cider-connect-cljs`, see xref:platforms/nbb.adoc[nbb].

== Limitations & Caveats

* Everything will be treated as a Clojure connection, regardless of the underlying platform.
* Errors will be displayed only as overlays. (The default CIDER error buffer is not implemented currently).
* The amount of functionality you'll get will be dependent on how well the nREPL server you're using implements the core nREPL protocol.
