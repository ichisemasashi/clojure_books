CIDERは**C**lojure( Script) **I**nteractive **D**evelopment **E**nvironment の**R**ocks! 

CIDERは、Clojureの xref:usage/interactive_programming.adoc[対話型プログラミング] のサポート機能をEmacsに拡張します。この機能は xref:usage/cider_mode.adoc[cider-mode] を中心としたもので、 https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode[clojure-mode] を補完するEmacsのマイナーモードです。`clojure-mode`がClojureソースファイルの編集をサポートするのに対して、`cider-mode`はコンパイル、デバッグ、定義とドキュメントの検索、テストの実行などのために実行中のClojureプロセスと対話するためのサポートを追加します。

.SLIMEからインスピレーションを得た
****
CIDERはもともと、強力なCommon Lisp対話型開発環境 https://github.com/slime/slime[SLIME] にインスパイアされた。当初、私たちはSLIMEのコア機能をClojureに適応させることから始めましたが、時間の経過とともにCIDERは多くの分野でSLIMEとはかなり異なるものになりました。CIDERの初期の歴史についてもっと知りたい方は、 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X-1fJm25Ww&list=PLZdCLR02grLoc322bYirANEso3mmzvCiI&index=6[この発表] をチェックしてください。

== Overview

CIDER aims to provide an interactive development experience similar to the one you'd get when programming in Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp (with https://github.com/slime/slime[SLIME] or https://github.com/joaotavora/sly[Sly]), Scheme (with https://github.com/jaor/geiser[Geiser]) and Smalltalk.

Programmers are expected to program in a very dynamic and incremental manner, constantly re-evaluating existing Clojure definitions and adding new ones to their running applications. You never stop/start a Clojure application while using CIDER - you're constantly interacting with it and changing it.  Depending on who you're asking that approach is named either "interactive programming/development" or "REPL-driven programming". We prefer the former term and we'll be using it throughout CIDER's documentation.

TIP: You can find more details about the typical CIDER workflow in the xref:usage/interactive_programming.adoc[Interactive Programming] section.

CIDER's built on top of https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl[nREPL], the Clojure networked REPL server.

CIDER's basic architecture looks something like this:

image::cider_architecture.png[,600]

Clojure code gets executed by an nREPL server. CIDER sends requests to the server and processes its responses. The server's functionality is augmented by additional https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[nREPL middleware], designed specifically to address the needs of an interactive development environment like CIDER.

.An Editor-agnostic Foundation
****
Much of the nREPL middleware we originally developed for CIDER is editor-agnostic and is being used by other Clojure development environments as well (e.g. https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace[vim-fireplace] & https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva[Calva]).

== Features

CIDER packs plenty of features. Here are some of them (in no particular order):

* Interactive code evaluation
* Powerful REPL
* Code completion
* Code reloading
* Definition & documentation lookup
* Enhanced error reporting
* `clojure.test` integration
* `clojure.spec` integration
* Interactive debugger
* ClojureScript support
* Support for xref:platforms/overview.adoc[alternative Clojure platforms](e.g. ClojureCLR, babashka, nbb & lumo)

And many many more... The rest of this manual will be exploring CIDER's features in great detail.

== CIDER in Action

Below you can see a typical CIDER session.

image::cider-overview.png[CIDER Screenshot]

Here the user checked the documentation for `clojure.core/merge` straight from the source buffer and then jumped to a REPL buffer to try out something there.

Here's also a video demo of CIDER's essential functionality:

You can find several other demo videos on the xref:additional_resources.adoc[Additional Resources] page.

== What's Next?

So, what to do next? While you can peruse the documentation in whatever way you’d like, here are a few recommendations:

* xref:basics/installation.adoc[Install] CIDER and get it xref:basics/up_and_running.adoc[up and running]
* Get familiar with xref:usage/interactive_programming.adoc[interactive programming] and xref:usage/cider_mode.adoc[cider-mode]
* xref:config/basic_config.adoc[Configure] CIDER to your liking
* Explore the xref:additional_packages.adoc[additional packages] that can make you more productive
