# Acknowledgments

So many people helped me birth this weird baby, and I am humbled and
grateful for all their support.

First, thanks to Jess, my wife, for doing the illustrations that
complete this book, giving it the visual character I had hoped for.
Thanks, too, for the support and for putting up with me when I was in
crazy-eyed writer mode. (P.S. It feels bizarre to thank my wife via a
programming book's front matter.)

Thanks to my friends and colleagues at McKinsey who read early revisions
and encouraged me to keep writing. Foremost among them are Pat
Shaughnessy, Alex Rothenberg, Thomas Newton, Jalil Fanaian, Chris
Parker, Mark Daggett, Christian Lilley, and Mike Morreale. Y'all are so
great; please move to Durham.

Thanks to my friend Bridget Hillyer for being a constant source of
support and positivity. I always feel like you have my back, and it
means a lot to me! Thanks, too, to my friend Joe Jackson, for reading,
listening to me blather, and offering feedback, and for making me feel
cool by gushing about this book to other people in front of me. Alan
Dipert, friend, tech reviewer, and now coworker, I give thee a million
thanks for your excellent technical editing and for introducing me to
Clojure in the first place.

I don't know if every writer continually asks himself, "Why the hell am
I doing this? Is anyone even going to read it?" but I certainly did. So
I want to thank all the friendly folks who wrote to me and suggested
edits while the initial web version of this book was being written. That
positive feedback made me feel confident that I was doing something
worthwhile. By the same token, thanks to everyone who bought the Leanpub
version!

A big thank you to Clojure community leaders Eric Normand, David Nolen,
and Alex Miller for giving this book positive press. See you at the next
Conj!

Finally, a bazillion thank yous to the magnificent folks at No Starch
Press for all your help in shaping this book into something I'm
immensely proud of. Thank you for your high standards. Thank you for
continually pushing for greater clarity, and for even suggesting jokes.
(Seph's "ball of wax" edit still makes me crack up.) Seph Kramer, Riley
Hoffman, Hayley Baker, Alison Law, Tyler Ortman, Anne Marie Walker:
thank you!
