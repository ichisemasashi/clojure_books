# How to Use Emacs, an Excellent Clojure Editor

On your journey to Clojure mastery, your editor will be your closest
ally. I highly recommend working with Emacs, but you can, of course, use
any editor you want. If you don't follow the thorough Emacs instructions
in this chapter, or if you choose to use a different editor, it's
worthwhile to at least invest some time in setting up your editor to
work with a REPL. Two alternatives that I recommend and that are well
regarded in the community are [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) and
[Nightcode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/).

The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a
Clojure REPL, which allows you to instantly try out your code as you
write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning
Clojure and, later, when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also
great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact, Emacs is written in a
Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp).

By the end of this chapter, your Emacs setup will look something like
Figure 2-1.

side, REPL on the other
:::

To get there, you'll start by installing Emacs and setting up a
new-person-friendly Emacs configuration. Then you'll learn the basics:
how to open, edit, and save files, and how to interact with Emacs using
essential key bindings. Finally, you'll learn how to actually edit
Clojure code and interact with the REPL.

## Installation

You should use the latest major version of Emacs, Emacs 24, for the
platform you're working on:

-   **OS X** Install vanilla Emacs as a Mac app from
    *<http://emacsformacosx.com>*. Other options, like Aquamacs, are
    supposed to make Emacs more "Mac-like," but they're problematic in
    the long run because they're set up so differently from standard
    Emacs that it's difficult to use the Emacs manual or follow along
    with tutorials.
-   **Ubuntu** Follow the instructions at
    *<https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs>*.
-   **Windows** You can find a binary at
    *<http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/>*. After you download and
    unzip the latest version, you can run the Emacs executable under
    *bin\\runemacs.exe*.

After you've installed Emacs, open it. You should see something like
Figure 2-2.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-fresh.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-2: The screen Emacs displays when you open it for the first
time
:::

Welcome to the cult of Emacs! You've made Richard Stallman proud!

## []{#Anchor}Configuration

I've created a repository of all the files you need to configure Emacs
for Clojure, available at
<https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/archive/book1.zip>.

NOTE: These tools are constantly being updated, so if the instructions
below don\'t work for you or you want to use the latest configuration,
please read the instructions at
<https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/>.

Do the following to delete your existing Emacs configuration and install
the Clojure-friendly one:

1.  Close Emacs.
2.  Delete *\~/.emacs* or *\~/.emacs.d* if they exist. (Windows users,
    your emacs files will probably live in
    *C:\\Users\\your_user_name\\AppData\\Roaming\\*. So, for example,
    you would delete *C:\\Users\\jason\\AppData\\Roaming\\.emacs.d*.)
    This is where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting
    these files and directories will ensure that you start with a clean
    slate.
3.  Download the Emacs configuration zip file listed above and unzip it.
    Its contents should be a folder, *emacs-for-clojure-book1*. Run [mv
    path/to/emacs-for-]{.LiteralBold}[clojure]{.LiteralBold}[-book1
    \~/.emacs.d]{.LiteralBold}.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  Open Emacs.

When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a
bunch of useful packages. Once the activity stops, go ahead and just
quit Emacs, and then open it again. (If you don\'t see any activity,
that\'s OK! Quit and restart Emacs just for funsies.) After you do so,
you should see a window like the one in Figure 2-3.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-configged.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-3: How Emacs looks after installing your sweet new
configuration
:::

Now that we've got everything set up, let's learn how to use Emacs!

## Emacs Escape Hatch

Before we dig in to the fun stuff, you need to know an important Emacs
key binding: [ctrl]{.Keycap}-G. This key binding quits whatever Emacs
command you're trying to run. So if things aren't going right, hold down
[ctrl]{.Keycap}, press G, and then try again. It won't close Emacs or
make you lose any work; it'll just cancel your current action.

## Emacs Buffers

All editing happens in an Emacs *buffer*. When you first start Emacs, a
buffer named `*scratch*` is open. Emacs will always show you the name of
the current buffer at the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 2-4.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-buffer-name.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-4: Emacs will always show you the name of the current buffer.
:::

By default, the` *scratch* `buffer handles parentheses and indentation
in a way that's optimal for Lisp development but is inconvenient for
writing plain text. Let's create a fresh buffer so we can play around
without having unexpected things happen. To create a buffer, do this:

1.  Hold down [ctrl]{.Keycap} and press X.
2.  Release [ctrl]{.Keycap}.
3.  Press B.

We can express the same sequence in a more compact format: **C-x b**.

After performing this key sequence, you'll see a prompt at the bottom of
the application, as shown in Figure 2-5.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-buffer-prompt.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-5: The minibuffer is where Emacs prompts you for input.
:::

This area is called the *minibuffer*, and it is where Emacs prompts you
for input. Right now it's prompting us for a buffer name. You can enter
the name of a buffer that is already open, or you can enter a new buffer
name. Type in[ emacs-fun-times]{.LiteralBold} and press
[enter]{.Keycap}. You should now see a completely blank buffer and can
just start typing. You'll find that keys mostly work the way you'd
expect. Characters appear as you type them. The up, down, left, and
right arrow keys move you as you'd expect, and [enter]{.Keycap} creates
a new line.

You'll also notice that you're not suddenly sporting a bushy Unix beard
or Birkenstocks (unless you had them to begin with). This should help
ease any lingering trepidation you feel about using Emacs. When you're
done messing around, go ahead and *kill* the buffer by typing **C-x k
enter**. (It might come as a surprise, but Emacs is actually quite
violent, making ample use of the term *kill*.)

Now that you've killed the `emacs-fun-times` buffer, you should be back
in the `*scratch*` buffer. In general, you can create as many new
buffers as you want with **C-x b**. You can also quickly switch between
buffers using the same command. When you create a new buffer this way,
it exists only in memory until you save it as a file; buffers aren't
necessarily backed by files, and creating a buffer doesn't necessarily
create a file. Let's learn about working with files.

## Working with Files

The key binding for opening a file in Emacs is **C-x C-f**. Notice that
you'll need to hold down [ctrl]{.Keycap} when pressing both X and F.
After you do that, you'll get another minibuffer prompt. Navigate to
*\~/.emacs.d/customizations/ui.el*, which customizes the way Emacs looks
and how you can interact with it. Emacs opens the file in a new buffer
with the same name as the filename. Let's go to line 37 and uncomment it
by removing the leading semicolons. It will look like this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(setq initial-frame-alist '((top . 0) (left . 0) (width . 120) (height . 80)))
```
:::
:::

Then change the values for `width` and `height`, which set the
dimensions in *characters* for the active window. By changing these
values, you can set the Emacs window to open at a certain size every
time it starts. Try something small at first, like 80 and 20:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(setq initial-frame-alist '((top . 0) (left . 0) (width . 80) (height . 20)))
```
:::
:::

Now save your file with the following key binding: **C-x C-s**. You
should get a message at the bottom of Emacs like
`Wrote /Users/snuffleupagus/``.emacs.d/customizations/ui.el`. You can
also try saving your buffer using the key binding you use in other
applications (for example, [ctrl]{.Keycap}-S or [cmd]{.Apple}-S). The
Emacs configuration you downloaded should allow that to work, but if it
doesn't, it's no big deal.

After saving the file, quit Emacs and start it again. I bet it's very
tiny! See my example in Figure 2-6.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/tinemacs.png){width="300"}

::: caption
Figure 2-6: You can configure Emacs to set its height and width every
time you open it.
:::

Go through that same process a couple of times until Emacs starts at a
size that you like. Or just comment out those lines again and be done
with it (in which case Emacs will open at its default width and height).
If you're done editing *ui.el*, you can close its buffer with **C-x k**.
Either way, you're done saving your first file in Emacs! If something
crazy happens, you can follow the instructions in ["Configuration" on
page 13](#Anchor) to get Emacs working again.

If you want to create a new file, just use **C-x C-f** and enter the new
file's path in the minibuffer. As soon as you save the buffer, Emacs
will create a file with the buffer's contents at the path you entered.

Let's recap:

1.  In Emacs, editing takes place in buffers*.*
2.  To switch to a buffer, use **C-x b** and enter the buffer name in
    the minibuffer*.*
3.  To create a new buffer, use **C-x b** and enter a new buffer name.
4.  To open a file, use **C-x C-f** and navigate to the file.
5.  To save a buffer to a file, use **C-x C-s**.
6.  To create a new file, use **C-x C-f** and enter the new file's path.
    When you save the buffer, Emacs will create the file on the
    filesystem.

## Key Bindings and Modes

You've already come a long way! You can now use Emacs like a very basic
editor. This should help you get by if you ever need to use Emacs on a
server or are forced into pairing with an Emacs nerd.

However, to really be productive, it'll be useful for you to know some
*key* details about key bindings (ha-ha!). Then I'll introduce Emacs
modes. After that, I'll cover some core terminology and go over a bunch
of super useful key bindings.

### Emacs Is a Lisp Interpreter

The term *key binding* derives from the fact that Emacs binds
*keystrokes* to *commands*, which are just elisp functions (I'll use
*command* and *function* interchangeably). For example, **C-x b** is
bound to the function `switch-to-buffer`. Likewise, **C-x C-s** is bound
to `save-file`.

But Emacs goes even further than that. Even simple keystrokes like **f**
and **a** are bound to a function, in this case `self-insert-command`,
the command for adding characters to the buffer you're editing.

From Emacs's point of view, all functions are created equal, and you can
redefine all functions, even core functions like `save-file`. You
probably won't *want* to redefine core functions, but you can.

You can redefine functions because, at its core, Emacs is *just* a Lisp
interpreter that happens to load code-editing facilities. Most of Emacs
is written in elisp, so from the perspective of Emacs, `save-file` is
just a function, as is `switch-to-buffer` and almost any other command
you can run. Not only that, but any functions you create are treated the
same way as built-in functions. You can even use Emacs to execute elisp,
modifying Emacs as it runs.

The freedom to modify Emacs using a powerful programming language is
what makes Emacs so flexible and why people like me are so crazy about
it. Yes, it has a lot of surface-level complexity that can take time to
learn. But underlying Emacs is the elegant simplicity of Lisp and the
infinite tinkerability that comes with it. This tinkerability isn't
limited to just creating and redefining functions. You can also create,
redefine, and remove key bindings. Conceptually, key bindings are just
an entry in a lookup table associating keystrokes with functions, and
that lookup table is completely modifiable.

You can also run commands by name, without a specific key binding, using
**M-x** [function-name]{.LiteralBoldItal} (for example, **M-x**
[save-buffer]{.LiteralBold}). *M* stands for *meta*, a key that modern
keyboards don't possess but which is mapped to [alt]{.Keycap} on Windows
and Linux and [option ]{.Keycap}on Macs. **M-x** runs the `smex`
command, which prompts you for the name of another command to be run.

Now that you understand key bindings and functions, you'll be able to
understand what modes are and how they work.

### Modes

An Emacs *mode* is a collection of key bindings and functions that are
packaged together to help you be productive when editing different types
of files. (Modes also do things like tell Emacs how to do syntax
highlighting, but that's of secondary importance, and I won't cover that
here.)

For example, when you're editing a Clojure file, you'll want to load
Clojure mode. Right now I'm writing a Markdown file and using Markdown
mode, which has lots of useful key bindings specific to working with
Markdown. When editing Clojure, it's best to have a set of
Clojure-specific key bindings, like **C-c C-k** to load the current
buffer into a REPL and compile it.

Modes come in two flavors: *major* modes and *minor* modes. Markdown
mode and Clojure mode are major modes. Major modes are usually set by
Emacs when you open a file, but you can also set the mode explicitly by
running the relevant Emacs command, for example with` `**M-x**
[clojure-mode]{.LiteralBold} or **M-x** [major-mode]{.LiteralBold}. Only
one major mode is active at a time.

Whereas major modes specialize Emacs for a certain file type or
language, minor modes usually provide functionality that's useful across
file types. For example, abbrev mode "automatically expands text based
on pre-defined abbreviation definitions" (per the Emacs
manual^[1.](#footnote-5680-1){#footnote-5680-1-backlink
.footnote-link}^). You can have multiple minor modes active at the same
time.

You can see which modes are active on the *mode line*, as shown in
Figure 2-7.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-mode-line.png)

::: {.para-style-override-4 .caption}
Figure 2-7: The mode line shows you which modes are active.
:::

If you open a file and Emacs doesn't load a major mode for it, chances
are that one exists. You'll just need to download its package. Speaking
of which . . .

### Installing Packages

Many modes are distributed as *packages*, which are just bundles of
elisp files stored in a package repository. Emacs 24, which you
installed at the beginning of this chapter, makes it very easy to browse
and install packages. **M-x** [package-list-packages]{.LiteralBold} will
show you almost every package available; just make sure you run **M-x**
[package-refresh-contents]{.LiteralBold} first so you get the latest
list. You can install packages with **M-x**
[package-install]{.LiteralBold}.

You can also customize Emacs by loading your own elisp files or files
you find on the Internet. The "Beginner's Guide to Emacs" (found at
*<http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/10/04/beginners-guide-to-emacs/>*)
has a good description of how to load customizations under the section
"Loading New Packages" toward the bottom of the article.

## Core Editing Terminology and Key Bindings

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/pirate.png){.right}

If all you want to do is use Emacs like a text editor, you can skip this
section entirely! But you'll be missing out on some great stuff. In this
section, we'll go over key Emacs terms; how to select, cut, copy, and
paste text; how to select, cut, copy, and paste text (see what I did
there? Ha ha ha!); and how to move through the buffer efficiently.

To get started, open a new buffer in Emacs and name it *jack-handy*.
Then enter the following Jack Handy quotations:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
If you were a pirate, you know what would be the one thing that would
really make you mad? Treasure chests with no handles. How the hell are
you supposed to carry it?!

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the
face.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
```
:::
:::

Use this example to experiment with navigation and editing in this
section.

### Point

If you've been following along, you should see a red-orange rectangle in
your Emacs buffer. This is the *cursor*, and it's the graphical
representation of the *point*. Point is where all the magic happens: you
insert text at point, and most editing commands happen in relation to
point. And even though your cursor appears to rest on top of a
character, point is actually located between that character and the
previous one.

For example, place your cursor over the *f* in *If you were a pirate*.
Point is located between *I* and *f*. Now, if you use **C-k**, all the
text from the letter *f* onward will disappear. **C-k** runs the command
`kill-line`, which *kills* all text after point on the current line
(I'll talk more about killing later). Undo that change with **C-/**.
Also, try your normal OS key binding for undo; that should work as well.

### Movement

You can use your arrow keys to move point just like any other editor,
but many key bindings allow you to navigate more efficiently, as shown
in Table 2-1.

1.  Table 2-1: Key Bindings for Navigating Text

  Keys        Description
  ----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C-a**     Move to beginning of line.
  **M-m**     Move to first non-whitespace character on the line.
  **C-e**     Move to end of line.
  **C-f**     Move forward one character.
  **C-b**     Move backward one character.
  **M-f**     Move forward one word (I use this a lot).
  **M-b**     Move backward one word (I use this a lot, too).
  **C-s**     Regex search for text in current buffer and move to it. Press **C-s** again to move to next match.
  **C-r**     Same as **C-s**, but search in reverse.
  **M-\<**    Move to beginning of buffer.
  **M-\>**    Move to end of buffer.
  **M-g g**   Go to line.

Go ahead and try out these key bindings in your *jack-handy* buffer!

### Selection with Regions

In Emacs, we don't *select* text. We create *regions*, and we do so by
setting the *mark* with **C-spc** ([ctrl]{.Keycap}-spacebar). Then, when
you move point, everything between mark and point is the region. It's
very similar to [shift]{.Keycap}-selecting text for basic purposes.

For example, do the following in your *jack-handy* buffer:

1.  Go to the beginning of the file.
2.  Use **C-spc**.
3.  Use **M-f** twice. You should see a highlighted region encompassing
    *If you*.
4.  Press backspace. That should delete *If you*.

One cool thing about using mark instead of Shift-selecting text is that
you're free to use all of Emacs's movement commands after you set the
mark. For example, you could set a mark and then use **C-s** to search
for some bit of text hundreds of lines down in your buffer. Doing so
would create a very large region, and you wouldn't have to strain your
pinky holding down [shift]{.Keycap}.

Regions also let you confine an operation to a limited area of the
buffer. Try this:

1.  Create a region encompassing *The face of a child can say it all*.
2.  Use **M-x** [replace-string]{.LiteralBold} and replace *face* with
    *head*.

This will perform the replacement within the current region rather than
the entire buffer after point, which is the default behavior.

### Killing and the Kill Ring

In most applications we can *cut* text, which is only mildly violent. We
can also *copy* and *paste*. Cutting and copying add the selection to
the clipboard, and pasting copies the contents of the clipboard to the
current application. In Emacs, we take the homicidal approach and *kill*
regions, adding them to the *kill ring*. Don't you feel *braver* and
*truer* knowing that you're laying waste to untold kilobytes of text? We
can then *yank*, inserting the most recently killed text at point. We
can also *copy* text to the kill ring without actually killing it.

Why bother with all this morbid terminology? Well, first, so you won't
be frightened when you hear someone talking about killing things in
Emacs. But more important, Emacs allows you to do tasks that you can't
do with the typical cut/copy/paste clipboard featureset.

Emacs stores multiple blocks of text on the kill ring, and you can cycle
through them. This is cool because you can cycle through to retrieve
text you killed a long time ago. Let's see this in action:

1.  Create a region over the word *Treasure* in the first line.
2.  Use **M-w**, which is bound to the `kill-ring-save` command. In
    general, **M-w** is like copying. It adds the region to the kill
    ring without deleting it from your buffer.
3.  Move point to the word *choreography* on the last line.
4.  Use **M-d**, which is bound to the `kill-word` command. This adds
    *choreography* to the kill ring and deletes it from your buffer.
5.  Use **C-y**. This will yank the text you just killed,
    *choreography*, inserting it at point.
6.  Use **M-y**. This will remove *choreography* and yank the next item
    on the kill ring, *Treasure*.

You can see some useful kill/yank key bindings in Table 2-2.

1.  Table 2-2: Key Bindings for Killing and Yanking Text

  Keys      Description
  --------- ----------------------------------------
  **C-w**   Kill region.
  **M-w**   Copy region to kill ring.
  **C-y**   Yank.
  **M-y**   Cycle through kill ring after yanking.
  **M-d**   Kill word.
  **C-k**   Kill line.

### Editing and Help

Table 2-3 shows some additional, useful, editing key bindings you should
know about for dealing with spacing and expanding text.

1.  Table 2-3: Other Useful Editing Key Bindings

  Keys       Description
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Tab**    Indent line.
  **C-j**    New line and indent, equivalent to [enter]{.KeycapBox} followed by [tab]{.KeycapBox}.
  **M-/**    Hippie expand; cycles through possible expansions of the text before point.
  **M-\\**   Delete all spaces and tabs around point. (I use this one a lot.)

Emacs also has excellent built-in help. The two key bindings shown in
Table 2-4 will serve you well.

1.  Table 2-4: Key Bindings for Built-in Help

  Keys                        Description
  --------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C-h k** **key-binding**   Describe the function bound to the key binding. To get this to work, you actually perform the key sequence after typing **C-h k**.
  **C-h f**                   Describe function.

The help text appears in a new *window*, a concept I will cover later in
the chapter. For now, you can close help windows by pressing **C-x o
q**.

## Using Emacs with Clojure

Next, I'll explain how to use Emacs to efficiently develop a Clojure
application. You'll learn how to start a REPL process that's connected
to Emacs and how to work with Emacs windows. Then I'll cover a
cornucopia of useful key bindings for evaluating expressions, compiling
files, and performing other handy tasks. Finally, I'll show you how to
handle Clojure errors and introduce some features of Paredit, an
optional minor mode, which is useful for writing and editing code in
Lisp-style languages.

If you want to start digging in to Clojure code, please do skip ahead!
You can always return later.

### Fire Up Your REPL!

As you learned in Chapter 1, a REPL allows you to interactively write
and run Clojure code. The REPL is a running Clojure program that gives
you a prompt and then reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result,
and loops back to the prompt. In Chapter 1, you started the REPL in a
terminal window with `lein repl`. In this section, you'll start a REPL
directly in Clojure.

To connect Emacs to a REPL, you'll use the Emacs packageCIDER, available
at *<https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/>*. If you followed the
configuration instructions earlier in this chapter, you should already
have it installed, but you can also install it by running **M-x**
[package-install]{.LiteralBold}, entering [cider]{.LiteralBold}, and
pressing [enter]{.Keycap}.

CIDER allows you to start a REPL within Emacs and provides you with key
bindings that allow you to interact with the REPL more efficiently. Go
ahead and start a REPL session now. Using Emacs, open the file
*clojure-noob/src/clojure_noob/core.clj*, which you created in
Chapter 1. Next, use **M-x** [cider-jack-in]{.LiteralBold}. This starts
the REPL and creates a new buffer where you can interact with it. After
a short wait (it should be less than a minute), you should see something
like Figure 2-8.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-jack-in.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-8: What your Emacs should look like after running M-x
[cider-jack-in]{.LiteralCaption}
:::

Now we have two windows: our *core.clj* file is open on the left, and
the REPL is running on the right. If you've never seen Emacs split in
half like this, don't worry! I'll talk about how Emacs splits windows in
a second. In the meantime, try evaluating some code in the REPL. Type in
the following bolded lines. The result that you should see printed in
the REPL when you press [enter]{.Keycap} is shown after each line of
code. Don't worry about the code at this time; I'll cover all these
functions in the next chapter.

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 2 3 4)
; => 10
(map inc [1 2 3 4])
; => (2 3 4 5)
(reduce + [5 6 100])
; => 111
```
:::
:::

Pretty nifty! You can use this REPL just as you used `lein repl` in the
first chapter. You can also do a whole lot more, but before I go into
that, I'll explain how to work with split-screen Emacs.

### Interlude: Emacs Windows and Frames

Let's take a quick detour to talk about how Emacs handles frames and
windows, and to go over some useful window-related key bindings. Feel
free to skip this section if you're already familiar with Emacs windows.

Emacs was invented in, like, 1802 or something, so it uses terminology
slightly different from what you're used to. What you would normally
refer to as a *window*, Emacs calls a *frame*, and the frame can be
split into multiple *windows*. Splitting into multiple windows allows
you to view more than one buffer at a time. You already saw this happen
when you ran `cider-jack-in` (see Figure 2-9).

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-windows.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-9: In Emacs, a frame contains windows.
:::

Table 2-5 shows several key bindings for working with the frame and
windows.

1.  Table 2-5: Emacs Window Key Bindings

  Keys        Description
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C-x o**   Switch cursor to another window. Try this now to switch between your Clojure file and the REPL.
  **C-x 1**   Delete all other windows, leaving only the current window in the frame. This doesn't close your buffers, and it won't cause you to lose any work.
  **C-x 2**   Split frame above and below.
  **C-x 3**   Split frame side by side.
  **C-x 0**   Delete current window.

I encourage you to try the Emacs window key bindings. For example, put
your cursor in the left window, the one with the Clojure file, and use
**C-x 1**. The other window should disappear, and you should see only
the Clojure code. Then do the following:

-   Use **C-x 3** to split the window side by side again.
-   Use **C-x o** to switch to the right window.
-   Use **C-x b** [\*cider-repl\*]{.LiteralBold} to switch to the CIDER
    buffer in the right window.

Once you've experimented a bit, set up Emacs so that it contains two
side-by-side windows with Clojure code on the left and the CIDER buffer
on the right, as in the previous images. If you're interested in
learning more about windows and frames, the Emacs manual has a ton of
info: see
*<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Windows.html#Windows>*.

Now that you can navigate Emacs windows, it's time to learn some Clojure
development key bindings!

### A Cornucopia of Useful Key Bindings

Now you're ready to learn some key bindings that will reveal the true
power of using Emacs for Clojure projects. These commands will let you
evaluate, tweak, compile, and run code with just a few dainty
keystrokes. Let's start by going over how to quickly evaluate an
expression.

At the bottom of *core.clj*, add the following:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(println "Cleanliness is next to godliness")
```
:::
:::

Now use **C-e** to navigate to the end of the line, and then use **C-x
C-e**.The text `Cleanliness is next to godliness` should appear in the
CIDER buffer, as shown in Figure 2-10.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-eval-last-expression.png)

::: caption
Figure 2-10: Instantly evaluating code from another buffer in the REPL
:::

The key binding **C-x C-e** runs the command
`cider-eval-last-expression`. As the name suggests, this command sends
the expression immediately preceding point to the REPL, which then
evaluates the expression. You can also try **C-u C-x C-e**, which prints
the result of the evaluation after point.

Now let's try to run the `-main` function we wrote in Chapter 1 so we
can let the world know that we're little teapots.

In the *core.clj* buffer, use **C-c M-n M-n**. This key binding sets the
namespace to the namespace listed at the top of your current file, so
the prompt in the right window should now read `clojure-noob.core>`. I
haven't gone into detail about namespaces yet, but for now it's enough
to know that a namespace is an organizational mechanism that allows us
to avoid naming conflicts. Next, enter [(-main)]{.LiteralBold} at the
prompt. The REPL should print `I'm a little teapot!` How exciting!

Now let's create a new function and run it. At the bottom of *core.clj*,
add the following:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(defn train
  []
  (println "Choo choo!"))
```
:::
:::

When you're done, save your file and use **C-c C-k** to compile your
current file within the REPL session. (You have to compile your code for
the REPL to be aware of your changes.) Now if you run `(train)` in the
REPL, it will echo back `Choo choo!`.

While still in the REPL, try **C-↑** ([ctrl]{.Keycap} plus the up arrow
key). **C-↑** and **C-↓** cycle through your REPL history, which
includes all the Clojure expressions that you've asked the REPL to
evaluate.

Note for Mac users: by default, OS X maps **C-↑**, **C-↓**, **C-←**, and
**C-→** to Mission Control commands. You can change your Mac key
bindings by opening System Preferences, and then going to
Keyboard[4]{.MenuArrow}Shortcuts[4]{.MenuArrow}Mission Control.

Finally, try this:

1.  Type [(-main]{.LiteralBold} at the REPL prompt. Note the lack of a
    closing parenthesis.
2.  Press **C-enter**.

CIDER should close the parenthesis and evaluate the expression. This is
just a nice little convenience that CIDER provides for dealing with so
many parentheses.

CIDER also has a few key bindings that are great when you're learning
Clojure. Pressing **C-c C-d C-d** will display documentation for the
symbol under point, which can be a huge time-saver. When you're done
with the documentation, press **q** to close the documentation buffer.
The key binding **M-.** will navigate to the source code for the symbol
under point, and **M-,** will return you to your original buffer and
position. Finally, **C-c C-d C-a** lets you search for arbitrary text
across function names and documentation. This is a great way to find a
function when you can't exactly remember its name.

The CIDER README (*<https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/>*) has a
comprehensive list of key bindings that you can learn over time, but for
now, Tables 2-6 and 2-7 contain a summary of the key bindings we just
went over.

1.  Table 2-6: Clojure Buffer Key Bindings

  Keys              Description
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C-c M-n M-n**   Switch to namespace of current buffer.
  **C-x C-e**       Evaluate expression immediately preceding point.
  **C-c C-k**       Compile current buffer.
  **C-c C-d C-d**   Display documentation for symbol under point.
  **M-. and M-,**   Navigate to source code for symbol under point and return to your original buffer.
  **C-c C-d C-a**   Apropros search; find arbitrary text across function names and documentation.

1.  Table 2-7: CIDER Buffer Key Bindings

  Keys           Description
  -------------- ---------------------------------
  **C-↑, C-↓**   Cycle through REPL history.
  **C-enter**    Close parentheses and evaluate.

### How to Handle Errors

In this section, you'll write some buggy code so you can see how Emacs
responds to it and how you can recover from the error and continue on
your merry way. You'll do this in both the REPL buffer and the
*core.clj* buffer. Let's start with the REPL. At the prompt, type
[(map)]{.LiteralBold} and press [enter]{.Keycap}. You should see
something like Figure 2-11.

![](/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-error.png)

::: {.caption .para-style-override-10}
Figure 2-11: This is what happens when you run bad code in the REPL.
:::

As you can see, calling `map` with no arguments causes Clojure to lose
its mind---it shows an `ArityException` error message in your REPL
buffer and fills your left window with text that looks like the ravings
of a madman. These ravings are the *stack trace*, which shows the
function that actually threw the exception, along with which function
called *that* function, down the stack of function calls.

Clojure's stack traces can be difficult to decipher when you're just
starting, but after a while you'll learn to get useful information from
them. CIDER gives you a hand by allowing you to filter stack traces,
which reduces noise so you can zero in on the cause of your exception.
Line 2 of the `*cider-error*` buffer has the filters Clojure, Java,
REPL, Tooling, Duplicates, and All. You can click each option to
activate that filter. You can also click each stack trace line to jump
to the corresponding source code.

Here's how to close the stack trace in the left window:

1.  Use **C-x o** to switch to the window.
2.  Press **q** to close the stack trace and go back to CIDER.

If you want to view the error again, you can switch to the
`*cider-error*` buffer. You can also get error messages when trying to
compile files. To see this, go to the *core.clj* buffer, write some
buggy code, and compile:

1.  Add `(map)` to the end.
2.  Use **C-c C-k** to compile.

You should see a `*cider-error*` buffer similar to the one you saw
earlier. Again, press **q** to close the stack trace.

### Paredit

While writing code in the Clojure buffer, you may have noticed some
unexpected things happening. For example, every time you type a left
parenthesis, a right parenthesis immediately gets inserted.

This occurs thanks to *paredit-mode*, a minor mode that turns Lisp's
profusion of parentheses from a liability into an asset. Paredit ensures
that all parentheses, double quotes, and brackets are closed, relieving
you of that odious burden.

Paredit also offers key bindings to easily navigate and alter the
structure created by all those parentheses. In the next section, I'll go
over the most useful key bindings, but you can also check out a
comprehensive cheat sheet at
*<https://github.com/georgek/paredit-cheatsheet/blob/master/paredit-cheatsheet.pdf>*(in
the cheat sheet, the red pipe represents point).

However, if you're not used to it, paredit can sometimes be annoying. I
think it's more than worth your while to take some time to learn it, but
you can always disable it with **M-x** [paredit-mode]{.LiteralBold},
which toggles the mode on and off.

The following section shows you the most useful key bindings.

#### Wrapping and Slurping

*Wrapping* surrounds the expression after point with parentheses.
*Slurping* moves a closing parenthesis to include the next expression to
the right. For example, say we start with this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 2 3 4)
```
:::
:::

and we want to get this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (* 2 3) 4)
```
:::
:::

We can wrap the `2`, add an asterisk, and then slurp the `3`. First,
place point, which is represented here as a vertical pipe, `|`:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 |2 3 4)
```
:::
:::

Then type **M-(**, the binding for *paredit-wrap-round*, getting this
result:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (|2) 3 4)
```
:::
:::

Add the asterisk and a space:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (* |2) 3 4)
```
:::
:::

To slurp in the `3`, press **C-→**:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (* |2 3) 4)
```
:::
:::

This makes it easy to add and extend parentheses without wasting
precious moments holding down arrow keys to move point.

#### Barfing

Suppose, in the preceding example, you accidentally slurped the four. To
unslurp it (also known as *barfing*), place your cursor (`|`) anywhere
in the inner parentheses:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (|* 2 3 4))
```
:::
:::

Then use **C-←**:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(+ 1 (|* 2 3) 4)
```
:::
:::

Ta-da! Now you know how to expand and contract parentheses at will.

#### Navigation

Often when writing in a Lisp dialect, you'll work with expressions like
this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(map (comp record first)
     (d/q '[:find ?post
            :in $ ?search
            :where
            [(fulltext $ :post/content ?search)
             [[?post ?content]]]]
          (db/db)
          (:q params)))
```
:::
:::

With this kind of expression, it's useful to jump quickly from one
sub­expression to the next. If you put point right before an opening
parenthesis, **C-M-f** will take you to the closing parenthesis.
Similarly, if point is right after a closing parenthesis, **C-M-b** will
take you to the opening parenthesis.

Table 2-8 summarizes the paredit key bindings you just learned.

1.  Table 2-8: Paredit Key Bindings

  Keys                                   Description
  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **M-x** [paredit-mode]{.LiteralBold}   Toggle paredit mode.
  **M-(**                                Surround expression after point in parentheses (paredit-wrap-round).
  **C-**[→]{.char-style-override-2}      Slurp; move closing parenthesis to the right to include next expression.
  **C-**[←]{.char-style-override-2}      Barf; move closing parenthesis to the left to exclude last expression.
  **C-M-f**, **C-M-b**                   Move to the opening/closing parenthesis.

## Continue Learning

Emacs is one of the longest-lived editors, and its adherents often
approach fanaticism in their enthusiasm for it. It can be awkward to use
at first, but stick with it and you will be amply rewarded over your
lifetime.

Whenever I open Emacs, I feel inspired. Like a craftsman entering his
workshop, I feel a realm of possibility open before me. I feel the
comfort of an environment that has evolved over time to fit me
perfectly---an assortment of packages and key bindings that help me
bring ideas to life day after day.

These resources will help you as you continue on your Emacs journey:

-   *The Emacs Manual* provides excellent, comprehensive instructions.
    Spend some time with it every morning! Download the PDF and read it
    on the go:
    *<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html#Top>*.
-   *The Emacs Reference Card* is a handy cheat sheet:
    *<http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~helio/disciplinas/MC102/Emacs_Reference_Card.pdf>*.
-   *Mastering Emacs* by Mickey Petersen is one of the best Emacs
    resources available. Start with the reading guide:
    *<http://www.masteringemacs.org/reading-guide/>*.
-   For the more visually minded folks, I recommend the hand-drawn "How
    to Learn Emacs: A Beginner's Guide to Emacs 24 or Later" by Sacha
    Chua:
    *<http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs8.png>*.
-   Just press **C-h t** for the built-in tutorial.

## Summary

Whew! You've covered a lot of ground. You now know about Emacs's true
nature as a Lisp interpreter. Key bindings act as shortcuts to execute
elisp functions, and modes are collections of key bindings and
functions. You learned how to interact with Emacs on its own terms and
mastered buffers, windows, regions, killing, and yanking. Finally, you
learned how to easily work with Clojure using CIDER and paredit.

With all of this hard-won Emacs knowledge under your belt, it's time to
start learning Clojure in earnest!
