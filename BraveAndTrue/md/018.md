# Farewell!

As Semisonic's hit '90s song "Closing Time" teaches us, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. Congratulations, noble reader, on completing this Clojure journey. I hope you've found it rewarding, and I hope you're looking forward to more!

And believe me, there's so much more. One of the things I like most about Clojure is that there's an entire world to explore. Logic programming, parsers, type systems---name a fun realm of computer science, and you can investigate it with Clojure. I leave you with my humble suggestions of where to go next.

If you want to get a broad overview of the Clojure ecosystem, check out *http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/*, which lists hundreds of Clojure projects organized by the problem they solve.

If you're interested in web programming, a great place to start is the Luminus framework (*<http://www.luminusweb.net/>*). The documentation is excellent, and you'll have a website running in no time.

To stay up-to-date with Clojure news, a great resource is Eric Normand's Clojure Gazzette (*http://www.clojuregazette.com/*).  There's also the Clojure mailing list, of course (*https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure*) and the Clojure subreddit is a helpful, friendly place, too (*http://www.reddit.com/r/clojure*).

If Twitter is your social media outlet of choice, then \@swannodette (David Nolen), \@gigasquid (Carin Meier), \@puredanger (Alex Miller), \@ztellman (Zach Tellman), \@bbatsov (Bozhidar Batsov), and \@stuartsierra (Stuart Sierra) are your huckleberries. You could also follow me, \@nonrecursive!

Farewell, little teacup, and have fun Clojuring!
