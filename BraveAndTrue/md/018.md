# Farewell!

As Semisonic's hit '90s song "Closing Time" teaches us, every new
beginning comes from some other beginning's end. Congratulations, noble
reader, on completing this Clojure journey. I hope you've found it
rewarding, and I hope you're looking forward to more!

And believe me, there's so much more. One of the things I like most
about Clojure is that there's an entire world to explore. Logic
programming, parsers, type systems---name a fun realm of computer
science, and you can investigate it with Clojure. I leave you with my
humble suggestions of where to go next.

If you want to get a broad overview of the Clojure ecosystem, check out
[*http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/*](http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/),
which lists hundreds of Clojure projects organized by the problem they
solve.

If you're interested in web programming, a great place to start is the
Luminus framework (*<http://www.luminusweb.net/>*). The documentation is
excellent, and you'll have a website running in no time.

To stay up-to-date with Clojure news, a great resource is Eric Normand's
Clojure Gazzette
([*http://www.clojuregazette.com/*](http://www.clojuregazette.com/)).
There's also the Clojure mailing list, of course
([*https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure*](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure))
and the Clojure subreddit is a helpful, friendly place, too
([*http://www.reddit.com/r/clojure*](http://www.reddit.com/r/clojure)).

Farewell, little teacup, and have fun Clojuring!
