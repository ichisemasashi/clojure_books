# Building, Running, and the REPL

In this chapter, you'll invest a small amount of time up front to get
familiar with a quick, foolproof way to build and run Clojure programs.
It feels great to get a real program running. Reaching that milestone
frees you up to experiment, share your work, and gloat to your
colleagues who are still using last decade's languages. This will help
keep you motivated!

You'll also learn how to instantly run code within a running Clojure
process using a *Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)*, which allows you to
quickly test your understanding of the language and learn more
efficiently.

But first, I'll briefly introduce Clojure. Next, I'll cover Leiningen,
the de facto standard build tool for Clojure. By the end of the chapter,
you'll know how to do the following:

-   Create a new Clojure project with Leiningen
-   Build the project to create an executable JAR file
-   Execute the JAR file
-   Execute code in a Clojure REPL

## []{#Anchor}First Things First: What Is Clojure? {#First_Things_First__What_Is_Clojure_}

Clojure was forged in a mythic volcano by Rich Hickey. Using an alloy of
Lisp, functional programming, and a lock of his own epic hair, he
crafted a language that's delightful yet powerful. Its Lisp heritage
gives you the power to write code more expressively than is possible in
most non-Lisp languages, and its distinct take on functional programming
will sharpen your thinking as a programmer. Plus, Clojure gives you
better tools for tackling complex domains (like concurrent programming)
that are traditionally known to drive developers into years of therapy.

When talking about Clojure, though, it's important to keep in mind the
distinction between the Clojure language and the Clojure compiler. The
Clojure language is a Lisp dialect with a functional emphasis whose
syntax and semantics are independent of any implementation. The compiler
is an executable JAR file, *clojure.jar*, which takes code written in
the Clojure language and compiles it to Java Virtual Machine ( JVM)
bytecode. You'll see *Clojure* used to refer to both the language and
the compiler, which can be confusing if you're not aware that they're
separate things. But now that you're aware, you'll be fine.

This distinction is necessary because, unlike most programming languages
like Ruby, Python, C, and a bazillion others, Clojure is a *hosted
language*. Clojure programs are executed within a JVM and rely on the
JVM for core features like threading and garbage collection. Clojure
also targets JavaScript and the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR),
but this book only focuses on the JVM implementation.

We'll explore the relationship between Clojure and the JVM more later
on, but for now the main concepts you need to understand are these:

-   JVM processes execute Java bytecode.
-   Usually, the Java Compiler produces Java bytecode from Java source
    code.
-   JAR files are collections of Java bytecode.
-   Java programs are usually distributed as JAR files.
-   The Java program *clojure.jar* reads Clojure source code and
    produces Java bytecode.
-   That Java bytecode is then executed by the same JVM process already
    running *clojure.jar*.

Clojure continues to evolve. As of this writing, it's at version 1.9.0,
and development is going strong. If you're reading this book in the far
future and Clojure has a higher version number, don't worry! This book
covers Clojure's fundamentals, which shouldn't change from one version
to the next. There's no need for your robot butler to return this book
to the bookstore.

Now that you know what Clojure is, let's actually build a freakin'
Clojure program!

## Leiningen {#Leiningen}

These days, most Clojurists use Leiningen to build and manage their
projects. You can read a full description of Leiningen in Appendix A,
but for now we'll focus on using it for four tasks:

1.  Creating a new Clojure project
2.  Running the Clojure project
3.  Building the Clojure project
4.  Using the REPL

Before continuing, make sure you have Java version 1.6 or later
installed. You can check your version by running `java -version` in your
terminal, and download the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from
[*http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html*](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
Then, install Leiningen using the instructions on the Leiningen home
page at [*http://leiningen.org/*](http://leiningen.org/) (Windows users,
note there's a Windows installer). When you install Leiningen, it
automatically downloads the Clojure compiler, *clojure.jar*.

### Creating a New Clojure Project {#Creating_a_New_Clojure_Project}

Creating a new Clojure project is very simple. A single Leiningen
command creates a project skeleton. Later, you'll learn how to do tasks
like incorporate Clojure libraries, but for now, these instructions will
enable you to execute the code you write.

Go ahead and create your first Clojure project by typing the following
in your terminal:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
lein new app clojure-noob
```
:::
:::

This command should create a directory structure that looks similar to
this (it's okay if there are some differences):

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
| .gitignore
| doc
| | intro.md
➊ | project.clj
| README.md
➋ | resources
| src
| | clojure_noob
➌ | | | core.clj
➍ | test
| | clojure_noob
| | | core_test.clj
```
:::
:::

This project skeleton isn't inherently special or Clojure-y. It's just a
convention used by Leiningen. You'll be using Leiningen to build and run
Clojure apps, and Leiningen expects your app to have this structure. The
first file of note is *project.clj* at ➊, which is a configuration file
for Leiningen. It helps Leiningen answer such questions as "What
dependencies does this project have?" and "When this Clojure program
runs, what function should run first?" In general, you'll save your
source code in *src/\<project_name\>*. In this case, the file
*src/clojure_noob/core.clj* at ➌ is where you'll be writing your Clojure
code for a while. The *test* directory at ➍ obviously contains tests,
and *resources* at ➋ is where you store assets like images.

### Running the Clojure Project {#Running_the_Clojure_Project}

Now let's actually run the project. Open *src/clojure_noob/core.clj* in
your favorite editor. You should see this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
➊ (ns clojure-noob.core
  (:gen-class))

➋ (defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot...yet."
  [& args]
➌   (println "Hello, World!"))
```
:::
:::

The lines at ➊ declare a namespace, which you don't need to worry about
right now. The `-main` function at ➋ is the *entry point* to your
program, a topic that is covered in Appendix A. For now, replace the
text `"Hello, ``World!"` at ➌ with `"I'm a little teapot!"`. The full
line should read `(println "I'm a little teapot!"))`.

Next, navigate to the *clojure_noob* directory in your terminal and
enter:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
lein run
```
:::
:::

![](/assets/images/cftbat/getting-started/teapot.png){.right}

You should see the output `"I'm a little teapot!"` Congratulations,
little teapot, you wrote and executed a program!

You'll learn more about what's actually happening in the program as you
read through the book, but for now all you need to know is that you
created a function, `-main`, and that function runs when you execute
`lein run` at the command line.

### Building the Clojure Project {#Building_the_Clojure_Project}

Using `lein run` is great for trying out your code, but what if you want
to share your work with people who don't have Leiningen installed? To do
that, you can create a stand-alone file that anyone with Java installed
(which is basically everyone) can execute. To create the file, run this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
lein uberjar
```
:::
:::

This command creates the file
*target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar*. You can
make Java execute it by running this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
java -jar target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```
:::
:::

Look at that! The file
*target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar* is your new,
award-winning Clojure program, which you can distribute and run on
almost any platform.

You now have all the basic details you need to build, run, and
distribute (very) basic Clojure programs. In later chapters, you'll
learn more details about what Leiningen is doing when you run the
preceding commands, gaining a complete understanding of Clojure's
relationship to the JVM and how you can run production code.

Before we move on to Chapter 2 and discuss the wonder and glory of
Emacs, let's go over another important tool: the []{#Anchor-3}REPL.

### Using the REPL {#Using_the_REPL}

The REPL is a tool for experimenting with code. It allows you to
interact with a running program and quickly try out ideas. It does this
by presenting you with a prompt where you can enter code. It then
*reads* your input, *evaluates* it, *prints* the result, and *loops*,
presenting you with a prompt again.

This process enables a quick feedback cycle that isn't possible in most
other languages. I strongly recommend that you use it frequently because
you'll be able to quickly check your understanding of Clojure as you
learn. Besides that, REPL development is an essential part of the Lisp
experience, and you'd really be missing out if you didn't use it.

To start a REPL, run this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
lein repl
```
:::
:::

The output should look like this:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
nREPL server started on port 28925
REPL-y 0.1.10
Clojure 1.9.0
    Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
Commands: (user/help)
    Docs: (doc function-name-here)
          (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
  Source: (source function-name-here)
          (user/sourcery function-name-here)
 Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
          (user/clojuredocs name-here)
          (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")
clojure-noob.core=>
```
:::
:::

The last line, `clojure-noob.core=>`, tells you that you're in the
`clojure``-noob.core` namespace. You'll learn about namespaces later,
but for now notice that the namespace basically matches the name of your
*src/clojure_noob/core.clj* file. Also, notice that the REPL shows the
version as *Clojure 1.9.0*, but as mentioned earlier, everything will
work okay no matter which version you use.

The prompt also indicates that your code is loaded in the REPL, and you
can execute the functions that are defined. Right now only one function,
`-main`, is defined. Go ahead and execute it now:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
clojure-noob.core=> (-main)
I'm a little teapot!
nil
```
:::
:::

Well done! You just used the REPL to evaluate a function call. Try a few
more basic Clojure functions:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
clojure-noob.core=> (+ 1 2 3 4)
10
clojure-noob.core=> (* 1 2 3 4)
24
clojure-noob.core=> (first [1 2 3 4])
1
```
:::
:::

Awesome! You added some numbers, multiplied some numbers, and took the
first element from a vector. You also had your first encounter with
weird Lisp syntax! All Lisps, Clojure included, employ *prefix
notation*, meaning that the operator always comes first in an
expression. If you're unsure about what that means, don't worry. You'll
learn all about Clojure's syntax soon.

Conceptually, the REPL is similar to Secure Shell (SSH). In the same way
that you can use SSH to interact with a remote server, the Clojure REPL
allows you to interact with a running Clojure process. This feature can
be very powerful because you can even attach a REPL to a live production
app and modify your program as it runs. For now, though, you'll be using
the REPL to build your knowledge of Clojure syntax and semantics.

One more note: going forward, this book will present code without REPL
prompts, but please do try the code! Here's an example:

::: listingblock
::: content
``` {.pygments .highlight}
(do (println "no prompt here!")
   (+ 1 3))
; => no prompt here!
; => 4
```
:::
:::

When you see code snippets like this, lines that begin with `; =>`
indicate the output of the code being run. In this case, the text
`no prompt here` should be printed, and the return value of the code is
`4`.

## Clojure Editors {#Clojure_Editors}

At this point you should have the basic knowledge you need to begin
learning the Clojure language without having to fuss with an editor or
integrated development environment (IDE). But if you do want a good
tutorial on a powerful editor, Chapter 2 covers Emacs, the most popular
editor among Clojurists. You absolutely do not need to use Emacs for
Clojure development, but Emacs offers tight integration with the Clojure
REPL and is well-suited to writing Lisp code. What's most important,
however, is that you use whatever works for you.

If Emacs isn't your cup of tea, here are some resources for setting up
other text editors and IDEs for Clojure development:

-   This YouTube video will show you how to set up Sublime Text 2 for
    Clojure development:
    *<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBl0rYXQdGg/>*.
-   Vim has good tools for Clojure development. This article is a good
    starting point:
    *<http://mybuddymichael.com/writings/writing-clojure-with-vim-in-2013.html>*.
-   Counterclockwise is a highly recommended Eclipse plug-in:
    *<https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw/wiki/GoogleCodeHome>*.
-   Cursive Clojure is the recommended IDE for those who use IntelliJ:
    *<https://cursiveclojure.com/>*
-   Nightcode is a simple, free IDE written in Clojure:
    *<https://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/>*.

## Summary {#Summary}

I'm so proud of you, little teapot. You've run your first Clojure
program! Not only that, but you've become acquainted with the REPL, one
of the most important tools for developing Clojure software. Amazing! It
brings to mind the immortal lines from "Long Live" by one of my personal
heroes:

> You held your head like a hero\
> On a history book page\
> It was the end of a decade\
> But the start of an age\
> ---Taylor Swift

Bravo!
