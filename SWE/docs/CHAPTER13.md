# CHAPTER 13  Test Doubles

Written by Andrew Trenk and Dillon Bly

Edited by Tom Manshreck

Unit tests are a critical tool for keeping developers productive and reducing defects in code. Although they can be easy to write for simple code, writing them becomes diffi‐ cult as code becomes more complex.
For example, imagine trying to write a test for a function that sends a request to an external server and then stores the response in a database. Writing a handful of tests might be doable with some effort. But if you need to write hundreds or thousands of tests like this, your test suite will likely take hours to run, and could become flaky due to issues like random network failures or tests overwriting one another’s data.
Test doubles come in handy in such cases. A test double is an object or function that can stand in for a real implementation in a test, similar to how a stunt double can stand in for an actor in a movie. The use of test doubles is often referred to as mock‐ ing, but we avoid that term in this chapter because, as we’ll see, that term is also used to refer to more specific aspects of test doubles.
Perhaps the most obvious type of test double is a simpler implementation of an object that behaves similarly to the real implementation, such as an in-memory database. Other types of test doubles can make it possible to validate specific details of your system, such as by making it easy to trigger a rare error condition, or ensuring a heavyweight function is called without actually executing the function’s implementation.
The previous two chapters introduced the concept of small tests and discussed why they should comprise the majority of tests in a test suite. However, production code often doesn’t fit within the constraints of small tests due to communication across multiple processes or machines. Test doubles can be much more lightweight than real implementations, allowing you to write many small tests that execute quickly and are not flaky.

## The Impact of Test Doubles on Software Development

The use of test doubles introduces a few complications to software development that require some trade-offs to be made. The concepts introduced here are discussed in more depth throughout this chapter:

- Testability
  - To use test doubles, a codebase needs to be designed to be testable—it should be possible for tests to swap out real implementations with test doubles. For exam‐ ple, code that calls a database needs to be flexible enough to be able to use a test double in place of a real database. If the codebase isn’t designed with testing in mind and you later decide that tests are needed, it can require a major commit‐ ment to refactor the code to support the use of test doubles.
- Applicability
  - Although proper application of test doubles can provide a powerful boost to engineering velocity, their improper use can lead to tests that are brittle, complex, and less effective. These downsides are magnified when test doubles are used improperly across a large codebase, potentially resulting in major losses in pro‐ ductivity for engineers. In many cases, test doubles are not suitable and engineers should prefer to use real implementations instead.
- Fidelity
  - Fidelity refers to how closely the behavior of a test double resembles the behavior of the real implementation that it’s replacing. If the behavior of a test double sig‐ nificantly differs from the real implementation, tests that use the test double likely wouldn’t provide much value—for example, imagine trying to write a test with a test double for a database that ignores any data added to the database and always returns empty results. But perfect fidelity might not be feasible; test dou‐ bles often need to be vastly simpler than the real implementation in order to be suitable for use in tests. In many situations, it is appropriate to use a test double even without perfect fidelity. Unit tests that use test doubles often need to be sup‐ plemented by larger-scope tests that exercise the real implementation.

## Test Doubles at Google

At Google, we’ve seen countless examples of the benefits to productivity and software quality that test doubles can bring to a codebase, as well as the negative impact they can cause when used improperly. The practices we follow at Google have evolved over time based on these experiences. Historically, we had few guidelines on how to effectively use test doubles, but best practices evolved as we saw common patterns and antipatterns arise in many teams’ codebases.
One lesson we learned the hard way is the danger of overusing mocking frameworks, which allow you to easily create test doubles (we will discuss mocking frameworks in more detail later in this chapter). When mocking frameworks first came into use at Google, they seemed like a hammer fit for every nail—they made it very easy to write highly focused tests against isolated pieces of code without having to worry about how to construct the dependencies of that code. It wasn’t until several years and countless tests later that we began to realize the cost of such tests: though these tests were easy to write, we suffered greatly given that they required constant effort to maintain while rarely finding bugs. The pendulum at Google has now begun swing‐ ing in the other direction, with many engineers avoiding mocking frameworks in favor of writing more realistic tests.
Even though the practices discussed in this chapter are generally agreed upon at Goo‐ gle, the actual application of them varies widely from team to team. This variance stems from engineers having inconsistent knowledge of these practices, inertia in an existing codebase that doesn’t conform to these practices, or teams doing what is easi‐ est for the short term without thinking about the long-term implications.

### Basic Concepts

Before we dive into how to effectively use test doubles, let’s cover some of the basic concepts related to them. These build the foundation for best practices that we will discuss later in this chapter.

#### An Example Test Double

Imagine an ecommerce site that needs to process credit card payments. At its core, it might have something like the code shown in Example 13-1.

Example 13-1. A credit card service
```java
class PaymentProcessor {
  private CreditCardService creditCardService;
  ...
  boolean makePayment(CreditCard creditCard, Money amount) {
    if (creditCard.isExpired()) { return false; }
    boolean success =
        creditCardService.chargeCreditCard(creditCard, amount);
    return success;
  }
}
```

It would be infeasible to use a real credit card service in a test (imagine all the trans‐ action fees from running the test!), but a test double could be used in its place to simulate the behavior of the real system. The code in Example 13-2 shows an extremely simple test double.

Example 13-2. A trivial test double
```java
class TestDoubleCreditCardService implements CreditCardService {
  @Override
  public boolean chargeCreditCard(CreditCard creditCard, Money amount) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

Although this test double doesn’t look very useful, using it in a test still allows us to test some of the logic in the makePayment() method. For example, in Example 13-3, we can validate that the method behaves properly when the credit card is expired because the code path that the test exercises doesn’t rely on the behavior of the credit card service.

Example 13-3. Using the test double
```java
@Test public void cardIsExpired_returnFalse() {
  boolean success = paymentProcessor.makePayment(EXPIRED_CARD, AMOUNT);
  assertThat(success).isFalse();
}
```

The following sections in this chapter will discuss how to make use of test doubles in more complex situations than this one.

#### Seams

Code is said to be testable if it is written in a way that makes it possible to write unit tests for the code. A seam is a way to make code testable by allowing for the use of test doubles—it makes it possible to use different dependencies for the system under test rather than the dependencies used in a production environment.
Dependency injection is a common technique for introducing seams. In short, when a class utilizes dependency injection, any classes it needs to use (i.e., the class’s depen‐ dencies) are passed to it rather than instantiated directly, making it possible for these dependencies to be substituted in tests.
Example 13-4 shows an example of dependency injection. Rather than the construc‐ tor creating an instance of CreditCardService, it accepts an instance as a parameter.

Example 13-4. Dependency injection
```java
class PaymentProcessor {
  private CreditCardService creditCardService;

  PaymentProcessor(CreditCardService creditCardService) {
    this.creditCardService = creditCardService;
  }
  ...
}
```

The code that calls this constructor is responsible for creating an appropriate Credit CardService instance. Whereas the production code can pass in an implementation of CreditCardService that communicates with an external server, the test can pass in a test double, as demonstrated in Example 13-5.

Example 13-5. Passing in a test double
```java
PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor =
    new PaymentProcessor(new TestDoubleCreditCardService());
```

To reduce boilerplate associated with manually specifying constructors, automated dependency injection frameworks can be used for constructing object graphs auto‐ matically. At Google, Guice and Dagger are automated dependency injection frame‐ works that are commonly used for Java code.
With dynamically typed languages such as Python or JavaScript, it is possible to dynamically replace individual functions or object methods. Dependency injection is less important in these languages because this capability makes it possible to use real implementations of dependencies in tests while only overriding functions or methods of the dependency that are unsuitable for tests.
Writing testable code requires an upfront investment. It is especially critical early in the lifetime of a codebase because the later testability is taken into account, the more difficult it is to apply to a codebase. Code written without testing in mind typically needs to be refactored or rewritten before you can add appropriate tests.

#### Mocking Frameworks

A mocking framework is a software library that makes it easier to create test doubles within tests; it allows you to replace an object with a mock, which is a test double whose behavior is specified inline in a test. The use of mocking frameworks reduces boilerplate because you don’t need to define a new class each time you need a test double.
Example 13-6 demonstrates the use of Mockito, a mocking framework for Java. Mockito creates a test double for `CreditCardService` and instructs it to return a spe‐ cific value.

Example 13-6. Mocking frameworks
```java
class PaymentProcessorTest {
  ...
  PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

  // Create a test double of CreditCardService with just one line of code.
  @Mock CreditCardService mockCreditCardService;
  @Before public void setUp() {
    // Pass in the test double to the system under test.
    paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(mockCreditCardService);
  }
  @Test public void chargeCreditCardFails_returnFalse() {
    // Give some behavior to the test double: it will return false
    // anytime the chargeCreditCard() method is called. The usage of
    // “any()” for the method’s arguments tells the test double to
    // return false regardless of which arguments are passed.
    when(mockCreditCardService.chargeCreditCard(any(), any())
      .thenReturn(false);
    boolean success = paymentProcessor.makePayment(CREDIT_CARD, AMOUNT);
    assertThat(success).isFalse();
  }
}
```

Mocking frameworks exist for most major programming languages. At Google, we use Mockito for Java, the googlemock component of Googletest for C++, and uni‐ ttest.mock for Python.
Although mocking frameworks facilitate easier usage of test doubles, they come with some significant caveats given that their overuse will often make a codebase more dif‐ ficult to maintain. We cover some of these problems later in this chapter.

## Techniques for Using Test Doubles

There are three primary techniques for using test doubles. This section presents a brief introduction to these techniques to give you a quick overview of what they are and how they differ. Later sections in this chapter go into more details on how to effectively apply them.
An engineer who is aware of the distinctions between these techniques is more likely to know the appropriate technique to use when faced with the need to use a test dou‐ ble.

### Faking

A fake is a lightweight implementation of an API that behaves similar to the real implementation but isn’t suitable for production; for example, an in-memory data‐ base. Example 13-7 presents an example of faking.

Example 13-7. A simple fake
```java
// Creating the fake is fast and easy.
AuthorizationService fakeAuthorizationService =
    new FakeAuthorizationService();
AccessManager accessManager = new AccessManager(fakeAuthorizationService):

// Unknown user IDs shouldn’t have access.
assertFalse(accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID));

// The user ID should have access after it is added to
// the authorization service.
fakeAuthorizationService.addAuthorizedUser(new User(USER_ID));
assertThat(accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID)).isTrue();
```

Using a fake is often the ideal technique when you need to use a test double, but a fake might not exist for an object you need to use in a test, and writing one can be challenging because you need to ensure that it has similar behavior to the real imple‐ mentation, now and in the future.

### Stubbing

Stubbing is the process of giving behavior to a function that otherwise has no behav‐ ior on its own—you specify to the function exactly what values to return (that is, you stub the return values).
Example 13-8 illustrates stubbing. The `when(...).thenReturn(...)` method calls from the Mockito mocking framework specify the behavior of the `lookupUser()` method.

Example 13-8. Stubbing
```java
// Pass in a test double that was created by a mocking framework.
AccessManager accessManager = new AccessManager(mockAuthorizationService):

// The user ID shouldn’t have access if null is returned.
when(mockAuthorizationService.lookupUser(USER_ID)).thenReturn(null);
assertThat(accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID)).isFalse();

// The user ID should have access if a non-null value is returned.
when(mockAuthorizationService.lookupUser(USER_ID)).thenReturn(USER);
assertThat(accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID)).isTrue();
```

Stubbing is typically done through mocking frameworks to reduce boilerplate that would otherwise be needed for manually creating new classes that hardcode return values.
Although stubbing can be a quick and simple technique to apply, it has limitations, which we’ll discuss later in this chapter.

### Interaction Testing

Interaction testing is a way to validate how a function is called without actually calling the implementation of the function. A test should fail if a function isn’t called the cor‐ rect way—for example, if the function isn’t called at all, it’s called too many times, or it’s called with the wrong arguments.
Example 13-9 presents an instance of interaction testing. The `verify(...)` method from the Mockito mocking framework is used to validate that `lookupUser()` is called as expected.

Example 13-9. Interaction testing
```java
// Pass in a test double that was created by a mocking framework.
AccessManager accessManager = new AccessManager(mockAuthorizationService);
accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID);

// The test will fail if accessManager.userHasAccess(USER_ID) didn’t call
// mockAuthorizationService.lookupUser(USER_ID).
verify(mockAuthorizationService).lookupUser(USER_ID);
```

Similar to stubbing, interaction testing is typically done through mocking frame‐ works. This reduces boilerplate compared to manually creating new classes that con‐ tain code to keep track of how often a function is called and which arguments were passed in.
Interaction testing is sometimes called mocking. We avoid this terminology in this chapter because it can be confused with mocking frameworks, which can be used for stubbing as well as for interaction testing.
As discussed later in this chapter, interaction testing is useful in certain situations but should be avoided when possible because overuse can easily result in brittle tests.

## Real Implementations

Although test doubles can be invaluable testing tools, our first choice for tests is to use the real implementations of the system under test’s dependencies; that is, the same implementations that are used in production code. Tests have higher fidelity when they execute code as it will be executed in production, and using real implementa‐ tions helps accomplish this.
At Google, the preference for real implementations developed over time as we saw that overuse of mocking frameworks had a tendency to pollute tests with repetitive code that got out of sync with the real implementation and made refactoring difficult. We’ll look at this topic in more detail later in this chapter.
Preferring real implementations in tests is known as classical testing. There is also a style of testing known as mockist testing, in which the preference is to use mocking frameworks instead of real implementations. Even though some people in the soft‐ ware industry practice mockist testing (including the creators of the first mocking frameworks), at Google, we have found that this style of testing is difficult to scale. It requires engineers to follow strict guidelines when designing the system under test, and the default behavior of most engineers at Google has been to write code in a way that is more suitable for the classical testing style.

### Prefer Realism Over Isolation

Using real implementations for dependencies makes the system under test more real‐ istic given that all code in these real implementations will be executed in the test. In contrast, a test that utilizes test doubles isolates the system under test from its depen‐ dencies so that the test does not execute code in the dependencies of the system under test.
We prefer realistic tests because they give more confidence that the system under test is working properly. If unit tests rely too much on test doubles, an engineer might need to run integration tests or manually verify that their feature is working as expected in order to gain this same level of confidence. Carrying out these extra tasks can slow down development and can even allow bugs to slip through if engineers skip these tasks entirely when they are too time consuming to carry out compared to run‐ ning unit tests.
Replacing all dependencies of a class with test doubles arbitrarily isolates the system under test to the implementation that the author happens to put directly into the class and excludes implementation that happens to be in different classes. However, a good test should be independent of implementation—it should be written in terms of the API being tested rather than in terms of how the implementation is structured.
Using real implementations can cause your test to fail if there is a bug in the real implementation. This is good! You want your tests to fail in such cases because it indicates that your code won’t work properly in production. Sometimes, a bug in a real implementation can cause a cascade of test failures because other tests that use the real implementation might fail, too. But with good developer tools, such as a Continuous Integration (CI) system, it is usually easy to track down the change that caused the failure.

#### Case Study: @DoNotMock

At Google, we’ve seen enough tests that over-rely on mocking frameworks to motivate the creation of the `@DoNotMock` annotation in Java, which is available as part of the ErrorProne static analysis tool. This annotation is a way for API owners to declare, “this type should not be mocked because better alternatives exist.”
If an engineer attempts to use a mocking framework to create an instance of a class or interface that has been annotated as `@DoNotMock`, as demonstrated in Example 13-10, they will see an error directing them to use a more suitable test strategy, such as a real implementation or a fake. This annotation is most commonly used for value objects that are simple enough to use as-is, as well as for APIs that have well-engineered fakes available.

Example 13-10. The `@DoNotMock` annotation
```java
@DoNotMock("Use SimpleQuery.create() instead of mocking.")
public abstract class Query {
  public abstract String getQueryValue();
}
```

Why would an API owner care? In short, it severely constrains the API owner’s ability to make changes to their implementation over time. As we’ll explore later in the chap‐ ter, every time a mocking framework is used for stubbing or interaction testing, it duplicates behavior provided by the API.
When the API owner wants to change their API, they might find that it has been mocked thousands or even tens of thousands of times throughout Google’s codebase! These test doubles are very likely to exhibit behavior that violates the API contract of the type being mocked—for instance, returning null for a method that can never return null. Had the tests used the real implementation or a fake, the API owner could make changes to their implementation without first fixing thousands of flawed tests.

### How to Decide When to Use a Real Implementation

A real implementation is preferred if it is fast, deterministic, and has simple depen‐ dencies. For example, a real implementation should be used for a value object. Exam‐ ples include an amount of money, a date, a geographical address, or a collection class such as a list or a map.
However, for more complex code, using a real implementation often isn’t feasible. There might not be an exact answer on when to use a real implementation or a test double given that there are trade-offs to be made, so you need to take the following considerations into account.

#### Execution time

One of the most important qualities of unit tests is that they should be fast—you want to be able to continually run them during development so that you can get quick feedback on whether your code is working (and you also want them to finish quickly when run in a CI system). As a result, a test double can be very useful when the real implementation is slow.
How slow is too slow for a unit test? If a real implementation added one millisecond to the running time of each individual test case, few people would classify it as slow. But what if it added 10 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds, 1 second, and so on?
There is no exact answer here—it can depend on whether engineers feel a loss in pro‐ ductivity, and how many tests are using the real implementation (one second extra per test case may be reasonable if there are five test cases, but not if there are 500). For borderline situations, it is often simpler to use a real implementation until it becomes too slow to use, at which point the tests can be updated to use a test double instead.
Parellelization of tests can also help reduce execution time. At Google, our test infra‐ structure makes it trivial to split up tests in a test suite to be executed across multiple servers. This increases the cost of CPU time, but it can provide a large savings in developer time. We discuss this more in Chapter 18.
Another trade-off to be aware of: using a real implementation can result in increased build times given that the tests need to build the real implementation as well as all of its dependencies. Using a highly scalable build system like Bazel can help because it caches unchanged build artifacts.

#### Determinism

A test is deterministic if, for a given version of the system under test, running the test always results in the same outcome; that is, the test either always passes or always fails. In contrast, a test is nondeterministic if its outcome can change, even if the sys‐ tem under test remains unchanged.
Nondeterminism in tests can lead to flakiness—tests can occasionally fail even when there are no changes to the system under test. As discussed in Chapter 11, flakiness harms the health of a test suite if developers start to distrust the results of the test and ignore failures. If use of a real implementation rarely causes flakiness, it might not warrant a response, because there is little disruption to engineers. But if flakiness hap‐ pens often, it might be time to replace a real implementation with a test double because doing so will improve the fidelity of the test.
A real implementation can be much more complex compared to a test double, which increases the likelihood that it will be nondeterministic. For example, a real imple‐ mentation that utilizes multithreading might occasionally cause a test to fail if the output of the system under test differs depending on the order in which the threads are executed.
A common cause of nondeterminism is code that is not hermetic; that is, it has dependencies on external services that are outside the control of a test. For example, a test that tries to read the contents of a web page from an HTTP server might fail if the server is overloaded or if the web page contents change. Instead, a test double should be used to prevent the test from depending on an external server. If using a test dou‐ ble is not feasible, another option is to use a hermetic instance of a server, which has its life cycle controlled by the test. Hermetic instances are discussed in more detail in the next chapter.
Another example of nondeterminism is code that relies on the system clock given that the output of the system under test can differ depending on the current time. Instead of relying on the system clock, a test can use a test double that hardcodes a specific time.

#### Dependency construction

When using a real implementation, you need to construct all of its dependencies. For example, an object needs its entire dependency tree to be constructed: all objects that it depends on, all objects that these dependent objects depend on, and so on. A test double often has no dependencies, so constructing a test double can be much simpler compared to constructing a real implementation.
As an extreme example, imagine trying to create the object in the code snippet that follows in a test. It would be time consuming to determine how to construct each individual object. Tests will also require constant maintenance because they need to be updated when the signature of these objects’ constructors is modified:

```
 Foo foo = new Foo(new A(new B(new C()), new D()), new E(), ..., new Z());
```

It can be tempting to instead use a test double because constructing one can be trivial. For example, this is all it takes to construct a test double when using the Mockito mocking framework:

```
@Mock Foo mockFoo;
```

Although creating this test double is much simpler, there are significant benefits to using the real implementation, as discussed earlier in this section. There are also often significant downsides to overusing test doubles in this way, which we look at later in this chapter. So, a trade-off needs to be made when considering whether to use a real implementation or a test double.
Rather than manually constructing the object in tests, the ideal solution is to use the same object construction code that is used in the production code, such as a factory method or automated dependency injection. To support the use case for tests, the object construction code needs to be flexible enough to be able to use test doubles rather than hardcoding the implementations that will be used for production.
